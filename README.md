This repository corresponds to the Master's Thesis in Bioinformatics titled **Docking assays of Musashi-1 allosteric RNA-binding sites**

- The `redact` directory contains the texfiles and assets used to elaborate the Thesis' manuscript
- The `code` directory contains the files regarding the computational work performed

The main output of this work has been the design of a protein-RNA docking protocol for `LightDock`. You can find the tutorial [here](https://lightdock.org/tutorials/0.9.3/rna_docking).
